# Tag_Input_Plugins

This project is used to create a input tag plugin.
You can use it just by adding a simple attribute to your input element.

=> [data-role='taginput']

Add the above attribute to your input element with the other neseccary attributes.
There are about two files in the js_file folder. 

First one is a jQuery file and other one is Vanilla javaScript, both the file work efficiently and does similar work.
Add one of the file to the below tag

<script src="...."></script>

If you want the preview, I have created a html file with css property.
